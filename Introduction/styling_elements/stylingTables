basic styles:

table {
  border-collapse: collapse;
  width: 100%;
}
td, th {
  border:1px solid black;
  text-align: center;
} 

The table cells have spacing between them by default, making double borders appear. The border-collapse property sets the borders to collapse into one, making the table look a lot better.

We can also provide some padding to the cells, to give the content some space to "breathe":

td, th {
  border:1px solid black;
  padding: 10px;
  text-align: center;
} 

background color to heading cells:

th {
  background-color: #d3d3d3;
}


CSS provides the nth-child() pseudo selector, which allows you to select specific rows and style them.
For example, we can style the 3rd row like this:

tr:nth-child(3) {
    background-color: #b0d1e4;
} 

The nth-child selector allows you to also define rules for the rows, instead of providing the number.
For example, we can style the odd and even rows separately, giving them different background colors:

tr:nth-child(even) {
  background-color: #b0d1e4;
}
tr:nth-child(odd) {
  background-color: #6aabd1;
} 

This will automatically apply the assigned styles to the odd and even rows.
