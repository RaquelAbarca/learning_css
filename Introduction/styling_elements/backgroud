The background-color property sets the background color for an element.

.box {
  background-color: red;
  height:100px;
  padding: 10px;
} 


You can also set an image as the background of an element, using the background-image property.
It has the following syntax:

.box {
  background-image: url('sl-logo.png');
  height:150px;
  padding: 10px;
}

The image address has to be put in quotes and enclosed by the url() attribute.
A small image is, by default, tiled to fill the box.
In case the image is larger than the element, it is not scaled down by default and we will see only the part that fits in the box.

The background-repeat property can control how the image is tiled (or repeated) in the box.
It can take the following values:

no-repeat: does not tile the image.

repeat-x: repeat horizontally.

repeat-y: repeat vertically.

repeat: repeat in both directions (default value).

.box {
    background-image: url('sl-logo.png');
    background-repeat: repeat-x;
    height:150px;
    padding: 10px;
  }
