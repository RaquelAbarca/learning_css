The float property allows you to float an element inside a container.

For example, we can float an image in a text, to make the text wrap on one side of it:

img {
    float: left;
}

The supported values are left and right.



Positioning 
To fine-tune the position of elements on the page, the position property can be used.

There are a number of different values the position property supports, changing the way the element is positioned.

By default, all elements have the position:static, which is the normal flow.



Relative Position 
With position: relative; the element is positioned relative to its normal position. 
The properties top, right, bottom, and left can be used to specify how the element will be shifted.

For example:

.special {
  position: relative;
  bottom: 30px;
  background-color: orange;
} 

This will shift the element 30px from the bottom.

The content of relatively positioned elements can be moved and overlap other elements, but the reserved space for the element is still preserved in the normal flow.





Absolute Position 
An absolutely positioned element is removed from the normal flow of the page. 
This is useful, for example, to create popup boxes, control menus, panels, etc.

For example:

.special {
  position: absolute;
  top:30px;
  left: 20px;
  background-color: orange;
} 

This will make the element position 30px from the top of the page and 20px from the left.
The element's position is relative to the first positioned parent element: for example, you could absolutely position an element inside a relatively positioned container.






Fixed Position 
Fixed positioning makes the element stick to a part of the visible area, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.

For example:

.special {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 30px;
  background-color: orange;
}

This makes the element stick to the bottom of the page, shifted by 30px.




z-index 
When elements are positioned outside the normal flow, they can overlap other elements.
The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others).

For example: 

article {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2;
}
.special {
  z-index: 1;
  position: absolute;
  top: 30px;
  left: 50%;

By default, the orange box would be above the article elements, however we made it go under them using a lower z-index value.
