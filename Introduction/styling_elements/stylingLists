By default, unordered list items are marked with round bullets, while ordered lists are numbered.

The list-style-type property allows you to change the markers to circle, square, decimal, disc, lower-alpha, lower-roman, etc.

ul {
  list-style-type: square; 
}



The list-style-position property specifies the position of the bullets: inside or outside.

ul {
  list-style-type: circle;
  list-style-position: inside;
}




The list-style-image property can be used to specify an image to be used as the list item marker.

ul {
  list-style-image: url("bullet.jpg");
} 

However, this property does not allow you to control the position and size of the image.

If you want to use an image as the marker, it's better to set the list-style-type to none and add a background image to the list items with the marker image, positioning it to the left.




The list-style property is a shorthand for setting list-style-type, list-style-image and list-style-position, all in one declaration:

ul {
 list-style: square outside none;
}
