with the width and height properties.

They can take both pixel and percentage values. 

For example, let's give the container box 50% of the page width:

.box {
  width: 50%;
  border: 3px solid red;
} 

Remember, the final width and height of the box are calculated by adding the padding and border widths.






Alternative Box Model 

It can be inconvenient to calculate the actual size of the box, because of the padding and border widths being added to it.
For this reason, CSS provides an alternative box model where the given width is taken by the box and includes the padding and border.
The model is turned on using box-sizing: border-box:

p {
  margin: 5px 10px 5px 10px;
  padding: 4px 7px 4px 7px;
  width: 200px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  border: 3px solid black;
}

Now, the paragraph box has the width 200px, irrespective of the padding and border widths.

Without the box-sizing property it would have the width: 200+7+3+7+3 = 220px.
