HTML elements appear as boxes. 
The box model defines how the different parts of the box -  margin, border, padding, and content, work together to create the box.
Here are the parts of the box:

The content box is the area where the content is displayed.

The padding box is the white space around the content.

The border box comes after the padding.

The margin box is the last one and defines the space between this box and other elements.



In the standard box model, the height and width attributes define the size of the content box.
Any padding and border is then added to that width and height to get the total size of the box.
For example, the total width of the box with paddings will be the sum of width plus padding left and padding right.

The margin is not counted towards the actual size of the box, it is the space outside the box.



The margin is the space around your box.

We can control all margins of an element at once using the margin property, in the following order: top, right, bottom, and left. 

The margins can be provided using separate properties.

The following style:

margin: 5px 10px 5px 10px; 

is equivalent to:

margin-top: 5px;
margin-right: 10px;
margin-bottom: 5px;
margin-left: 10px; 





The padding is the area between the border and the content. 

It is defined similar to the margin:

p {
  margin: 5px 10px 5px 10px;
  padding: 4px 7px 4px 7px;
  border: 3px solid black;
}
