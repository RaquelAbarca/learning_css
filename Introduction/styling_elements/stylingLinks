A link is by default blue in color and underlined. 

We can style links with CSS properties (e.g., color, font-family, background, etc.).

a {
  color: green;
} 

In addition, links can be styled differently, depending on what state they are in. The following selectors are available:

a:link - defines the style for normal unvisited links.

a:visited - defines the style for visited links.

a:active - a link becomes active once you click on it.

a:hover - a link is hovered when the mouse is over it.

a {
  color: green;
}
a:hover {
  background-color: yellow;
}

By default, all links are underlined.

We can remove the underline using the text-decoration property:

a {
  color: green;
  text-decoration: none;
 }






 It is common to style links as buttons and use them for navigation menus.

First, we put the links inside an unordered list:

<ul>
  <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
  <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
  <li><a href="#">Contacts</a></li>
</ul> 

Now, the CSS:

li {
  display: inline;
}
a {
  outline: none;
  text-decoration: none;
  display: inline-block;
  margin-left: 1%;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 10px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 31%;
  color: white;
  background-color: green;
}
a:hover {
  background: blue;
} 

We set the display property to inline for list items to make them sit on the same line with the others, acting as inline elements.
