Rules & Selectors 

The style rules are defined in a CSS file using selectors.

p {
  color: red;
} 



The selector p targets all the paragraph elements of our HTML.

A rule can have multiple styles, for example:

p {
   color: red;
  font-size: 42px;
}



Multiple Selectors 
 
We can target multiple selectors at once, by separating the selectors with a comma.

For example, let's make all h1 headings and paragraphs red:

h1, p {
  color: red;
}s
