change the font of the text using the font-family property.

.intro {
  font-family: Arial;
 }
 
The given font needs to be available on the user's computer to work.
There are only a certain number of fonts that are generally available across all systems. These are called web safe fonts and include: Arial, Courier New, Georgia, Times New Roman, Trebuchet MS, Verdana.

It's a common practice to define multiple fonts in the font-family property, so that if the first one is not available on for the user, the browser will try the next one:

.intro {
  font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif;
}

If the font name consists of multiple words, it has to be in quotes.




The font-style property is used to make text italic:

.intro {
  font-style: italic;
}





The font-weight property is used to make the text bold.

.intro {
  font-weight: bold;
 }
 You can also define the font weight with a number from 100 (thin) to 900 (thick). 400 is the same as normal, and 700 is the same as bold.
