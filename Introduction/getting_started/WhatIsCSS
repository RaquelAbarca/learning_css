CSS allows you to define styles for web pages.

It can be used to style text, change colors, font size, etc., as well as create layout - for example, create columns, sidebars, navigation menus, etc.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

CSS uses rules to style elements.
A rule is a group of style declarations.
An example rule could define all paragraphs to be red and large.

The style declarations have the following syntax:

property: value;

Each declaration specifies a property of the element(s) we are targeting, then a value that we'd like to give the property.

There are a number of ways we can apply CSS rules to our elements.
The first way is to define the style declarations right on the element we target, using the style attribute.
For example:

<p style="color:red">some text</p> 



We can have multiple declarations in the style rule:

<p style="color:red; font-size:26px">some text</p> 

The declarations are separated using a semicolon.
