Class Selector 
 

So far we have seen element selectors, which use the element names and target all of them in the HTML.

Often we need to target only a subset of elements, without changing the others. This can be done using a class selector.

We first need to add a class attribute to the elements we want to target:

<p class="intro">CSS is awesome</p>
<p>some other text goes here</p>


Class Selector 

Now, we can create the class selector in CSS:

.intro {
  color: red;
  background-color: yellow;
}

Note, that the class selector needs to start with a dot, followed by the class name that we gave to our element.
You can apply the .intro style rule to any element on your page, by simply adding the class attribute.



Selectors  

We can also create selectors based on the id attribute of elements.
This is done by using the hash (#) symbol before the id value:

#intro {
  color: red;
  background-color: yellow;
}  

This will target the element with id="intro" in our HTML.

You can have only one element with the same id on the page, while the class value can be used multiple times.
